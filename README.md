Bagel
=====

###Bagel - A simple guessing game for android.
**Bagels** (or PFB (Pico, Fermi, Bagels)) is a number guessing game, similar to MasterMind or Jotto.
It is a math/logic game commonly taught to schoolchildren to help them develop deductive reasoning skills.
• I will generate a random secret number. It will have 3 digits. No two digits will be same.
• You have to guess that number using clues(shown under "history"). 
• If I say “bagels”, that means that none of the three digits you guessed is in the secret number.
• If I say “pico”, then one of the digits in your guess is in the secret number, but it is in the wrong place.
• If I say “fermi”, then your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.
• Of course, even if you get a pico or fermi clue, you still don't know which digit in your guess is the correct one.
• You can also get multiple clues after each guess. 

###As an example, lets say that you thought of the secret number 489.
• Guess 1: 362 Bagel - no digit is correct.
• Guess 2: 820 Pico - the 8 is in the wrong place.
• Guess 3: 418 Pico Fermi - the 8 is in the wrong place, the 4 is in the correct place.
• Guess 4: 518 Pico - the 8 is in the wrong place.
• Guess 5: 487 Fermi Fermi - the 4 and 8 are in the correct place.
• Guess 6: 489 Fermi Fermi Fermi - all digits are in the correct place.

House rules determine whether zero can be used or not. Decreasing the number of choices obviously makes the game easier. Hardcore players can test their skill by playing with a number larger than 3 digits(in Advanced mode). Have Fun!

###In "Basic" mode:
• Adjust the digits using "up" and "down" buttons.
• Press "Make This Guess" to tell me your guess.You cannot guess same number again and again.
• Press < and > buttons to review these clues while playing.Select "New Game" from menu to end current game and start a new game.
• Duplicate guesses are not allowed and zero is not allowed.

###In "Advanced" mode:
• Check "zeroAllowed?" Toggle Button, if you want to include zero in secret number.
• Enter the LEVEL you want to play in the "level" EditText box. Level is same as the number of digits in the secret number.
• Now, press "Advanced(with Keypad)" button to start playing.
• Duplicate guesses are allowed.

#### News:
Original inspiration came from "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" By Al Sweigart.
1 day was what it took to make this app. So, please feel free to reach me through mail using in-app feedback.
• Also, feel free to suggest any apps that you love to have and I'll try my best to make 'em..!
