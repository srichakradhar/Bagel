It will have 3 digits. No two digits will be same.\r\n* You have to guess that number using clues(shown under \"history\"). \r\n* If I say “bagels”, that means that none of the three digits you guessed is in the secret number.\r\n* If I say “pico”, then one of the digits in your guess is in the secret number, but it is in the wrong place.\r\n* If I say “fermi”, then your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.\r\n* Of course, even if you get a pico or fermi clue, you still don't know which digit in your guess is the correct one.\r\n* You can also get multiple clues after each guess. \r\n\r\n###As an example, lets say that you thought of the secret number 489.\r\n* Guess 1: 362 Bagel - no digit is correct.\r\n* Guess 2: 820 Pico - the 8 is in the wrong place.\r\n* Guess 3: 418 Pico Fermi - the 8 is in the wrong place, the 4 is in the correct place.\r\n* Guess 4: 518 Pico - the 8 is in the wrong place.\r\n* Guess 5: 487 Fermi Fermi - the 4 and 8 are in the correct place.\r\n* Guess 6: 489 Fermi Fermi Fermi - all digits are in the correct place.\r\n\r\nHouse rules determine whether zero can be used or not. Decreasing the number of choices obviously makes the game easier. Hardcore players can test their skill by playing with a number larger than 3 digits(in Advanced mode). Have Fun!\r\n\r\n###In \"Basic\" mode:\r\n* Adjust the digits using \"up\" and \"down\" buttons.\r\n* Press \"Make This Guess\" to tell me your guess.You cannot guess same number again and again.\r\n* Press < and > buttons to review these clues while playing.Select \"New Game\" from menu to end current game and start a new game.\r\n* Duplicate guesses are not allowed and zero is not allowed.\r\n\r\n###In \"Advanced\" mode:\r\n* Check \"zeroAllowed?\" Toggle Button, if you want to include zero in secret number.\r\n* Enter the LEVEL you want to play in the \"level\" EditText box. Level is same as the number of digits in the secret number.\r\n* Now, press \"Choosen Level\" button to start playing.\r\n* By default, \"AutoSubmit\" checkbox is checked which removes the need to press the \"Guess\" button every time and the \"Guess\" button is disabled. It will be enabled when the \"AutoSubmit\" checkbox is unchecked.\r\n* Duplicate guesses are allowed.\r\n\r\n* Here are similar games, you can play online : http://www.dst-corp.com/james/Bagels.html\r\nhttp://www.newbedford.k12.ma.us/elementary/gomes/stjohn/Subjects/Math/Pico,%20Fermi,%20Bagel/Pico,%20Fermi,%20Bagel.html\r\n\r\n#### News:\r\n* Original inspiration came from \"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python\" By Al Sweigart.\r\n1 day was what it took to make this app. So, please feel free to reach me through mail using in-app feedback.\r\n* Post any suggestions on making the UI pleasant.\r\n* Also, feel free to suggest any apps that you love to have and I'll try my best to make 'em..!\r\n","google":"UA-42224312-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
